## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Upload your project to GitHub**  
   Include a detailed `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and commit history that reflects all stages from schema to analysis.

2. **Tag and Categorize**  
   Use tags like `#predictive-maintenance`, `#datascience`, `#BI`, and `#chemicalengineering`.

3. **Embed Power BI Dashboards**  
   - Use **Power BI Publish to Web** and link live dashboards into your GitHub Pages or repo wiki.

4. **Share with Stakeholders and the Community**  
   - Post a teaser on LinkedIn with screenshots and link to GitHub.
   - Submit to data science portfolios and communities like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Awesome-DataScience](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience), etc.
